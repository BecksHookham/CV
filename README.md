## Skills

#### Agile Methodologies and XP values
I'm a big advocate of following agile methodologies. While working on a team at Makers Academy, we made use of Sprints (usually 3 day sprints due to the short length of our projects), and other Agile ceremonies such as daily Standups, and Retrospects

#### Clean Code, and TDD
Strong believer in writing clean, easy to read, test driven code. During Makers, I learnt how to make my code adhere to good object oriented design principles (Such as DRY)

#### Fast, Independent Learner
During my time at Makers, I not only became proficient at Ruby, but also Javascript, Java, and many libraries and frameworks, including React, Express, Node, Sinatra, and Springboot.
I am proactive in learning relevant new technologies for projects.

#### Good Collaborator
Most of my time at Makers was spent working on a team, or pair programming (although I did several projects alone during the weekends). During this time I learnt good team communication skills, through practice and Makers emotional intelligence curriculum.
